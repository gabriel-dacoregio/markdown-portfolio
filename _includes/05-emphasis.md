I am a very **creative** person, and have a solid skill with logic that allows me an easier time when **learning new things**. I am fluent in both Portuguese and English, with Japanese already on the horizon as my *third* language.

Programming-wise, I am still an amateur (as of this writing), having just learned to code in **Python**, which I am traversing *Github* to train in, and I am looking to both improve my skills and learn new programming languages.

I have also studied **Psychology** in college for a number of years, which has helped me train my perceptiveness and overall ability in dealing with the *human factor* of things, so to speak.

Last, but not least, I do quite well with videogames, if I do say so myself. :tada:
